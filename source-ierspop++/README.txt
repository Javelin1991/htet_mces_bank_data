Final Project Title: A Pseudo-Incremental Rough Set-Based Pseudo Outer-Product with Ensemble Learning(ieRSPOP++) Fuzzy Neural Network with application to Option Trading and Artificial Ventilation

Project Summary:

Built a neuro-fuzzy inference system combining the following algorithms -
Adapted two-phase discrete incremental clustering for membership function generation
Adapted pseudo outer-product incremental rule generation with BCM theory and dynamic forgetting factor
Adapted rough set based attribute reduction using concept drift detection
Membership function merging based on threshold distance of average centre
Ensemble learning adapted by Learn++ and Adaptive Ensemble Classifier with Ebbingahus theory for weights
Ensemble cache and recall using Multiple Trace Theory
Single Knowledge base of all ensembles
