# Final Year Project (FYP) : Application of Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNNs) for bank failure prediction and missing data imputation
## Learning Outcome
I have learnt how a Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) works as well as how aritifical neural networks and fuzzy logic systems complement each other in FNNs. In this FYP, I have applied a Mamdani-type FNN, namely "SaFIN(FRI/E)++", to bank failure prediction. To further improve its prediction accuracy, I have further explored extensively different ways to reconstruct missing data in the data set. 
<br/>
<br/>
- Implemented a new ensemble-learning fuzzy neural network in Matlab by integrating an existing model, SAFIN(FRIE)++, with hierarchical complementary learning (HCL)
- Analyzed the data set that includes financial statements of banks in the United States over the course of 20 years
- Performed online learning to train the model and used 5-fold Cross Validation (CV) for training and testing in bank failure prediction
- Achieved over 95% accuracy with the ensemble-learning model on an imbalanced data set with very low type I and type II error
- Implemented a missing data imputation algorithm based on a combination of longitudinal and lateral
reconstruction by using DENFIS, i.e. known for its regression accuracy
- Successfully reconstructed missing data with relatively low mean absolute error (MAE) and decent correlation accuracy (R)
- Tested the quality of the imputed data by performing bank failure prediction using the ensemble-learning model
- Achieved about 2-3% better prediction accuracy with the reconstructed data set than with the original data set
