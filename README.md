# Final Year Project (FYP) : Neuro-Fuzzy approach to missing data imputation with application in bank failure prediction
## Learning Outcome
I have learnt how a Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) works as well as how aritifical neural networks and fuzzy logic systems complement each other in FNNs. In this FYP, I have applied a Mamdani-type FNN, namely "SaFIN(FRI/E)++", to bank failure prediction. To further improve its prediction accuracy, I have further explored extensively different ways to reconstruct missing data in the data set. 
<br/>
<br/>
- Applied a Mamdani-type Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN), namely "SaFIN(FRI/E)++", to predict bank failure by using Matlab
- Analyzed the data set that consists of financial statements from US banks over the course of 20 years
- Extracted salient features based on the fuzzy rules generated from the model to perform current year or one-year ahead or two-year ahead bank failure predictionÂ 
- Performed online learning to train the model and used 5-fold Cross Validation (CV) for training and testing 
- Analyzed the ROC curve to determine best cut-off point for Equal Error Rate (EER) for the above classification
- Implemented a missing data imputation algorithm based on a combination of longitudinal and lateral reconstruction by using a popular TSK-Neuro-Fuzzy system, "DENFIS"
- Successfully reconstructed missing data with relatively low mean absolute error (MAE) and decent correlation accuracy (R)
- Tested the quality of the imputed data by performing bank failure prediction using "SaFIN(FRI/E)++"
- The model showed better prediction accuracy with the reconstructed data set than with the original data set
