# Final Year Project (FYP) : Application of different Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNNs) for bank failure prediction and missing data reconstruction

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt how a Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) works as well as how aritifical neural networks and fuzzy logic systems complement each other in FNNs. In this FYP, I have applied a Mamdani-type FNN, namely "eMFIS(I/E)", to bank failure prediction. To further improve its prediction accuracy, I have further explored extensively different ways to reconstruct missing data in the data set. I have successfully reconstructed missing data with relatively low mean absolute error (MAE) by implementing the "simple-averaging" ensemble learning approach that is based on two popular TSK-Neuro-Fuzzy systems, that are "DENFIS" and "ANFIS".

With the new reconstructed data set, different benchmark experiments are also performed in order to prove its effectiveness in contribution to bank failure prediction. The rantionale to use eMFIS(I/E) to predict bank failure is that Mamdani-based FNNs have better interpretation capability as contrast to TSK-type FNNs. However, as for regression tasks, TSK-type FNNs are popular for achieving great accuracy, but compromising their interpretability. Hence, "ANFIS" and "DENFIS" are used to implement the simple-averaging parallel ensemble learning in order to reconstruct missing data and the experimental results 
are indeed promising.

(Note: The FYP is still in progress and expected to be completed in October 21st, 2019)
